# Application of Reinforcement Learning Methods

This repository implements a set of reinforcement learning algorithms to run on OpenAI gym environments.
The algorihtms implemented are:
- Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS)
- Actor-Critic Relative Entropy Policy Search (ACREPS)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

In practive they were only tested on the following environments:
- Pendulum Swingup
- Double Cartpole
- Furuta Pendulum
- Ball Ballancer
The last three are custom gym environments implemented in the quansar robots repository.
